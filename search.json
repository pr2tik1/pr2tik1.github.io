    "text": "Dockers are excellent tools in software development. The key benefit of Dockers is that they allow users to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. They have a low impact on the operating system and are very fast, using minimal disk space. Instead of encapsulating the entire machine, they encapsulate the environments for an application, making it easy to share code, rebuild applications, and distribute them.\nUsing Microsoft‚Äôs extension called : Dev Containers we can harness these benefits. The Dev Containers extension enables the use of a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. This helps developers in the following ways:\n\nDevelop with a consistent and reproducible environment.\nQuickly swap between different, separate development environments and safely make updates without worrying about impacting your local machine.\nMake it easy for new team members / contributors to get up and running in a consistent development environment.\n\nPersonally, I have been using Dev Containers to manage projects with different requirements. As a software engineer at Elucidata, I am responsible for developing various applications that require different versions of R, Python, and JavaScript. Remote containers have been immensely helpful in keeping the dedicated packages for each application within their project directories only.\nWhile there are other alternatives such as virtual environments (e.g.- pyenv, venv) and package management tools (for e.g.¬†- packrat, renv), containerization proves to be more efficient for bigger projects where we have to manage these R and Python environments together. With minimal code, we can instruct the required installations and quickly reproduce the environment.\nThe Dev Containers extension supports two primary operating models:\n\nYou can use a container as your full-time development environment\nYou can attach to a running container to inspect it."

    "text": ".devcontainer/devcontainer.json\nWithin the .devcontainer folder the devcontainer.json config file helps the extension to determine the name of the container, which image to use, extensions to install, port to expose and other configurations. Few examples,\n\n1. Shiny Application\nConsider there are multiple projects that you are working on, and each of them require different R versions and packages. You can set the value of the image key from below to any version of choice for R.\n{\n    \"name\" : \"Project 1\",\n    \"image\": \"r-base:latest\" //Any version as per requirement from dockerhub\n}\n{\n    \"name\" : \"Project 2\",\n    \"image\": \"r-base:4.1\" //Any version as per requirement from dockerhub\n}\n\n\n2. Using Custom Docker Image\nNow, suppose you want to use your own image with a specific R version, package installations, and other tools/languages included. In that case, you can create a custom Dockerfile (just make sure to specify the correct path for this file) as follows,\n# Use the specified R base image\nFROM r-base:latest\n\n# Set non-interactive mode for apt-get\nENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n\n# Expose port 4200\nEXPOSE 4200\n\n# Install necessary system dependencies\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    make \\\n    build-essential \\\n    git \\\n    wget \\\n    curl \n\n## Python setup\n# Switch to user \"docker\" to install pyenv\nUSER docker\nRUN curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n\n# Set up Python paths\nENV PATH=\"/home/docker/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"\nENV PATH=\"/home/docker/.pyenv/versions/3.9.13/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Install Python 3.9.13\nRUN PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"--enable-shared\" pyenv install 3.9.13\n\n# Switch back to root user for the remaining steps\nUSER root\n\n## Python virtual env and packages\n# Copy requirements.txt into the image\nCOPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\n\n# Create and activate Python virtual environment\nRUN rm -rf my_venv && python3 -m venv my_venv && \\\n    . my_venv/bin/activate && \\\n    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && \\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Install R packages using renv\nCOPY renv.lock renv.lock\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('renv'); renv::restore()\"\nNow with this Dockerfile, run the extension using following devcontainer.json :\n{\n    \"name\": \"Custom App\",\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dockerfile\": \"Dockerfile\",  //path to your custom Dockerfile.\n      \"context\": \"..\"\n    },\n    \"remoteUser\": \"docker\"\n}\n\n\n3. Post Installation Step\nWhen it comes to development, there could be a constant update in list of packages in your project. Now building everytime for each newly added package can be time consuming. Hence, we can install packages after building the image with minimal layers. So that the files would like :\n\nThe updated config file .devcontainer/devcontainer.json would now look like:\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"Custom App\",\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dockerfile\": \"Dockerfile\", //path to your custom Dockerfile.\n      \"context\": \"..\"\n    },\n    \"remoteUser\": \"docker\",\n    \"postCreateCommand\": \"bash .devcontainer/build_environment.sh\" // Can use any scripting language of choice.\n}\n\nYou can use a bash script to install packages after the build of container .devcontainer/build_environment.sh :\n\n## Install R packages\nR -e \"install.packages('renv'); renv::restore()\"\n\n\n## Install python packages\nrm -rf my_venv && python3 -m venv my_venv && \\\n    . my_venv/bin/activate && \\\n    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && \\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt"

In this structure, data elements are grouped into parent-child relationships, where each parent can have one or more children, and each child can be a parent of other elements, forming multiple levels of nesting.\nConsider an example dataframe (dummy data for demonstration purposes) with a tree-like structure, where the columns or features exhibit parent-child relationships with other columns.\n\nGeneral Dataset: This dataframe contains classes and values organized in columns, as depicted in the sample data provided.\nSunburst Dataset: This hierarchical dataframe defines the logical parent-child relationships between columns and their corresponding values.\n\nThe following dataset is a dummy data for demonstration.\n\n#Importing pandas to handle dataframe\nimport pandas as pd\n# Suppress pandas warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../data/dummy_data.csv\")\ndata.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nState\nCity\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\n0\nIndia\nINMP\nA1\n512\n\n\n1\nIndia\nINCG\nB2\n12201\n\n\n2\nIndia\nINCG\nM1\n9021\n\n\n3\nUSA\nUSNY\nC2\n812\n\n\n4\nUSA\nUSNY\nN1\n821\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset is not in hierachical form.

    "text": "Exploring packrat\n\nWhat is packrat?\npackrat is another robust package management tool for R. It addresses the challenges of package management by providing project-specific libraries and snapshot capabilities.\n\n\nKey Features of packrat\n\nBundled Library: packrat creates a local library for each project, ensuring that packages are self-contained within the project directory.\nSnapshotting: Similar to renv, packrat enables you to create a snapshot of your project‚Äôs dependencies, promoting reproducibility.\nIntegration with IDEs: packrat integrates seamlessly with popular R IDEs, making it convenient for developers who rely on specific development environments.\n\n\n\nGetting Started with packrat\n# Install packrat\ninstall.packages(\"packrat\")\n\n# Initialize packrat in your project\nlibrary(packrat)\npackrat::init()\n\n# Install and snapshot dependencies\npackrat::install(\"package_name\")\npackrat::snapshot()"

    "text": "Choosing the Right Tool for You\nBoth renv and packrat offer powerful solutions to the challenges of R package management. Your choice may depend on personal preference, project requirements, or team workflows. Experiment with both tools and consider factors like ease of use, integration capabilities, and community support.\nEffective package management is the cornerstone of reproducibility and collaboration in R development. Choose wisely, and may your R projects flourish without the headaches of package chaos!"
